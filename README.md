# Towards Efficient Posterior Sampling in Deep Neural Networks by Exploiting Symmetry
This is the official repository for the publication "Towards Efficient Posterior Sampling in Deep Neural Networks by Exploiting Symmetry".

# demonstrated functionality
* cardinality of equioutput transformations for mlps
* probabilistic bound calculations
* performance comparison
    * MCMC (ours), MCMC (s.c.), DE, LA
* KL-divergence, practical evaluation
* symmetry removal algorithm
    * visualization of simple network posteriors
* interpretability example

Demonstrate this functionality in notebooks together with relevant visualizations. However training and sampling of models could be performed in scripts. I could call these scripts from within a notebook in the demo.
